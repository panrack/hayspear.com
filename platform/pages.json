Lids are difficult to store in a cabinet or drawer and her idea was an excellent solution for the problem. Joanne gathered up the wood galley rails that she wanted to use to hold the lids in place, drew me a picture of what she wanted. A couple of week passed and her determination for me to build this thing increased. I told her that I would build it for her, but she probably wouldn't like it.\r\n\r\nWe went to the shop one Sunday afternoon where this production became a piece of art almost a family heirloom, quickly just before midnight! Well we took it home, hung it over the island (another story as I don't claim to be a carpenter), tried it out with lids and more lids, skillets, pans, long kitchen utensils etc. In fact it worked so well and looked so good that we decided take it down and to paint it! \r\n\r\n\r\nI was confident that this piece of art would go unnoticed, but surprisingly everyone that came over for the holidays told us how cool it was and that we shuld be making them and selling them. OK let me take some pictures of it and put on ebay and see how popular it is! I set up an ebay account etc and surprisingly '''The first one we sold went to a lady in Guam!'''\r\n\r\n\r\nNot that we live in the sticks (just almost), it seemed that for the international community to find this product I would need a website. That was fine but no one that I knew had a website wich was about the time that Al Gore invented the internet, or just after that.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I learned how to build a website, a long process, we started getting calls and emails. Customers would want something a little different so we would build it for them.  After a while we had hanging pot racks, wall mounted pot racks, bookshelf racks, spice, lid and many combinations of the those.\r\n\r\nSince I built my first 2 horse trailer by myself when I was 14 years old (many years ago), I have learned a lot about blacksmithing, welding, machining and metal fabrication, as well as photography and web design. I do all of my website design from photography, photo editing, to creatively \r\nwriting descriptions for all of my products, plus we farm too.\r\n\r\n=www.custompotrack.com or www.panrack.zoovy.com websites=\r\nYou can buy on-line with secure checkout or call us to order or get information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[[Joanne's entire pot rack selection at either   www.panrack.zoovy.com   or for a name that is easier to remember   www.custompotrack.com   can be seen by clicking on the this link ]:url=http://custompotrack.com]\r\n\r\n=www.grapevinepotrack.com=\r\nTo see Joanne's website that contains only productions with grapevines and grape related racks and shelves.\r\n\r\nYou can buy on-line with secure checkout or call us to order or get information.\r\n\r\n[[Click on this link to go to www.grapevinepotrack.com ]:url=http://grapevinepotrack.com]\r\n\r\n=To see Joannes original www.panracks.com website which we out grew=\r\n[[Joanne's original www.panracks.com]:url=:http//www.panracks.com]\r\n"

It is not a bush hog or a string trimmer and it can be seen at [[www.fencehog.com]:url=http://www.fencehog.com] and [[www.panrack.zoovy.com ]:url=http://www.custompotrack.com/category/fence_runner_mower]\n\n\n=Hand Made Kitchen Organizers=\n==How we got started making Joanne's pot pan lid & spice rack for wall or ceiling installations.==\n\n (The edited and condensed version of a humorous and true story)\n\n\nJoanne & I have an island in our kitchen, Joanne wanted a hanging rack to place over the island to organize her skillets, sauce pans, long kitchen utensils as well as lid storage. Lids are difficult to store in a cabinet or drawer and her idea was an excellent solution for the problem. Joanne gathered up the wood galley rails that she wanted to use to hold the lids in place, drew me a picture of what she wanted. A couple of week passed and her determination for me to build this thing increased. I told her that I would build it for her, but she probably wouldn't like it.\n\nWe went to the shop one Sunday afternoon where this production became a piece of art almost a family heirloom, quickly just before midnight! Well we took it home, hung it over the island (another story as I don't claim to be a carpenter), tried it out with lids and more lids, skillets, pans, long kitchen utensils etc. In fact it worked so well and looked so good that we decided take it down and to paint it! \n\n\nI was confident that this piece of art would go unnoticed, but surprisingly everyone that came over for the holidays told us how cool it was and that we shuld be making them and selling them. OK let me take some pictures of it and put on ebay and see how popular it is! I set up an ebay account etc and surprisingly '''The first one we sold went to a lady in Guam!'''\n\n\nNot that we live in the sticks (just almost), it seemed that for the international community to find this product I would need a website. That was fine but no one that I knew had a website wich was about the time that Al Gore invented the internet, or just after that.\n\n\nAfter I learned how to build a website, a long process, we started getting calls and emails. Customers would want something a little different so we would build it for them.  After a while we had hanging pot racks, wall mounted pot racks, bookshelf racks, spice, lid and many combinations of the those.\n\nSince I built my first 2 horse trailer by myself when I was 14 years old (many years ago), I have learned a lot about blacksmithing, welding, machining and metal fabrication, as well as photography and web design. I do all of my website design from photography, photo editing, to creatively \nwriting descriptions for all of my products, plus we farm too.\n\n=www.custompotrack.com or www.panrack.zoovy.com websites=\nYou can buy on-line with secure checkout or call us to order or get information.\n\n\n\n[[Joanne's entire pot rack selection at either   www.panrack.zoovy.com   or for a name that is easier to remember   www.custompotrack.com   can be seen by clicking on the this link ]:url=http://custompotrack.com]\n\n=www.grapevinepotrack.com=\nTo see Joanne's website that contains only productions with grapevines and grape related racks and shelves.\n\nYou can buy on-line with secure checkout or call us to order or get information.\n\n[[Click on this link to go to www.grapevinepotrack.com ]:url=http://grapevinepotrack.com]\n\n=To see Joannes original www.panracks.com website which we out grew=\n[[Joanne's original www.panracks.com]:url=http://www.panracks.com]\n\n  \n\n\n\n"

Lids are difficult to store in a cabinet or drawer and her idea was an excellent solution for the problem. Joanne gathered up the wood galley rails that she wanted to use to hold the lids in place, drew me a picture of what she wanted. A couple of week passed and her determination for me to build this thing increased. I told her that I would build it for her, but she probably wouldn't like it.\n\nWe went to the shop one Sunday afternoon where this production became a piece of art almost a family heirloom, quickly just before midnight! Well we took it home, hung it over the island (another story as I don't claim to be a carpenter), tried it out with lids and more lids, skillets, pans, long kitchen utensils etc. In fact it worked so well and looked so good that we decided take it down and to paint it! \n\n\nI was confident that this piece of art would go unnoticed, but surprisingly everyone that came over for the holidays told us how cool it was and that we shuld be making them and selling them. OK let me take some pictures of it and put on ebay and see how popular it is! I set up an ebay account etc and surprisingly '''The first one we sold went to a lady in Guam!'''\n\n\nNot that we live in the sticks (just almost), it seemed that for the international community to find this product I would need a website. That was fine but no one that I knew had a website wich was about the time that Al Gore invented the internet, or just after that.\n\n\nAfter I learned how to build a website, a long process, we started getting calls and emails. Customers would want something a little different so we would build it for them.  After a while we had hanging pot racks, wall mounted pot racks, bookshelf racks, spice, lid and many combinations of the those.\n\nSince I built my first 2 horse trailer by myself when I was 14 years old (many years ago), I have learned a lot about blacksmithing, welding, machining and metal fabrication, as well as photography and web design. I do all of my website design from photography, photo editing, to creatively \nwriting descriptions for all of my products, plus we farm too.\n\n\n==PotRackUSA is our site that contains exclusively hang pot racks and wall pot racks\n\n[[PotRackUSA.com]:url=http://www.potrackusa.com]==\n\n==SpiceRackUSA is our site that contains exclusively hanging spice racks and wall spice racks and spice organizers\n\n[[SpiceRackUSA.com]:url=http://www.spicerackusa.com]==\n\n\n=www.custompotrack.com or www.panrack.zoovy.com websites=\nYou can buy on-line with secure checkout or call us to order or get information.\n\n\n\n[[Joanne's entire pot rack selection at either   www.panrack.zoovy.com   or for a name that is easier to remember   www.custompotrack.com   can be seen by clicking on the this link ]:url=http://custompotrack.com]\n\n=www.grapevinepotrack.com=\nTo see Joanne's website that contains only productions with grapevines and grape related racks and shelves.\n\nYou can buy on-line with secure checkout or call us to order or get information.\n\n[[Click on this link to go to www.grapevinepotrack.com ]:url=http://grapevinepotrack.com]\n\n=To see Joannes original www.panracks.com website which we out grew=\n[[Joanne's original www.panracks.com]:url=:http//www.panracks.com]\n"
